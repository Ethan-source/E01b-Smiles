The objective of this assignment was to rearrange the coordinates of the shapes it takes to make a yellow smiley face. As each page progresses, there are more lines of code that allow for easier and more specific placement of the shapes. The smiley faces in all of the pages were originally either all put in the corner coordinates of the screen (0,0), or were overlapping. It was my job to change the (x,y, height, and width)coordinates so that all of the shapes were placed correctly. Finally, on page main5.py all of the code was previously written, and I had to explain what each part of the code does.
